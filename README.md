In the city of Chicago, as of 2016, about 1.6 million rides are taken daily on the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) consisting of 1,888 buses and 2,276 train trips. As the second largest public transportation system in the United States, the CTA is a fundamental part of every day life for Chicago Residents. Therefore, the optimality of this system would benefit from a close examination and analysis of daily and weekly ridership. 

As one of my assignments during the BSMP Summer at Illinois Tech I accordingly store and clean up raw data sets from 2001 to 2016 provided by the CTA. Additionally, I've attempted to understand trends regarding difference in ridership in different areas across the city of Chicago and visualize through an interactive interface.
